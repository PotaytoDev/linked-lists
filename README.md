# linked-lists
Linked Lists project - from The Odin Project curriculum.

This is an implementation of the linked list dynamic data structure. The
purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the way a linked
list works to then better understand how to work with more complex data
structures such as graphs and binary trees.
